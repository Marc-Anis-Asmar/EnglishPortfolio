            <p class="cpa1">In this intriguing redesign of the cover for <span class="oblique">The Word Is Murder</span>, every element has been chosen to arouse curiosity and suspense, and to captivate the reader’s attention into the fiction of the book. Each color has been chosen wisely: the gray-black background establishes a sense of mystery and curiosity, the blood red reminds the reader of the murder committed, the death of Diana Cowper, as the gold-beige color adds elements of warmth and attachment to some characters. Moreover, typography plays a vital role in conveying the book's tone and themes. The title <span class="oblique">The Word Is Murder</span> presented has an aggressive quality and communicates the dark nature of the book. However, the typography of the author’s name creates a contrast with its classical display between the literary elegance and horrific murder.  Furthermore, the magnifying glass, a symbol of investigation and detective work, generates a sense of intrigue in readers. Such an element captures the feel of a murder mystery.  The polaroid image engages the reader’s curiosity as it is an essential element to the solving of the case, showing young actors Dan & Damian and adding a layer of intrigue. Fingerprints are a key element to a modern murder investigation and hint at the evidence that Anthony and Hawthorne will find throughout the story.</p>
